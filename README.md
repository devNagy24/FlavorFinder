## Introduction
FlavorFinder is a PHP-based web application that helps users explore and discover a variety of recipes. The user can search for recipes, bookmark their favorites, and review them at any time. The application relies on the Forkify API to fetch recipe data.

## Installation
Here are the installation steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine or server.
2. Import the `database.sql` file into your MySQL database. This file will create the necessary tables and populate them with data.
3. Update the `db.php` file to use your MySQL database credentials.
4. Navigate to the application's root directory in your browser to start using FlavorFinder.

## API Documentation

For more details, you can review the [Forkify API documentation](https://forkify-api.herokuapp.com/v2).
